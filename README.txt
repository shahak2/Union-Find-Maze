This program generates a random maze. It chooses random edges of a grid and removes them until the starting point and the exit point have a connecting path. 
By using Union-Find data structure it achieves O(n^2 α(n)) running time complexity, where α is the inverse Ackerman function.
This program use python and pygame.
